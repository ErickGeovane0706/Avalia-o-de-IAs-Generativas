# Roulette System

## Overview
The Roulette System is a simulation of a classic roulette game, utilizing HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript. This project implements real physics to create an engaging and realistic experience, featuring a beautifully designed interface with dark colors and gold accents.

## Features
- Realistic physics simulation including friction and gravity.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure with separate classes for `Roulette` and `Ball`.
- Circular collision detection for accurate ball interactions with roulette pins.
- Premium aesthetics designed for an immersive user experience.
